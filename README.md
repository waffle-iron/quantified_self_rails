### About

Quantified self is a simple calorie tracking application.

### Learning Goals
- Create a Rails API given specified endpoints and response formats.
- Create an Express API given specified endpoints and response formats.
- Create an API in a new language of the students choice given specified endpoints and response formats.
- Review and refactor code (in each of the three languages) so that it:
  - is well organized
  - clearly communicates intent
  - utilizes abstraction to hide complexity
  - breaks problems down into small methods/functions with a single responsibility
